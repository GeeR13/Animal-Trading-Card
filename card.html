			<p id="summary">Lions become capable at hunting at the age of two and are fully grown after 5 or 6 years. Male lions are distinguishable
				for their impressive manes, which signifies their masculinity and reflects their health. The darker and thicker the mane,
				the healthier the lion. It allows the lions to appear stronger and frightening to warn off enemies, particularly humans,
				and appeals to lionesses that are scientifically proven to mate more with lions with thick and dark manes. Lions with
				no manes are either genetically inbred or have been castrated.</p>
